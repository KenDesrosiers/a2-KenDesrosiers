      <p>As you wait, you will notice that orders will start to line up in front of the ice cream truck.
        These are the orders that need to be fulfilled in order to make money!</p>
      <img class="images" src="../assets/earningpoints.png"/>
      <p>In order to complete the orders and earn money, you need to click and drag the correct pictures from the menu
      and place them on top of the orders by the truck! You will earn the amount that the particular menu item costs.</p>

      <p>Be careful not to place a wrong item onto any of the orders; you will lose $10 no matter what flavor you messed up!</p>
